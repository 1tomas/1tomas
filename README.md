ğŸ’¡ About Me: Hi, I'm TomÃ¡s Caraccioli, and my coding journey began three years ago. ğŸš€

ğŸ”— Language Proficiency: I've honed my English skills from a young age through personalized training, giving me a strong command over the language.

ğŸ”§ Project Experience: I've tackled a variety of university projects across different programming languages, but my real strength lies in the backend. I'm passionate about creating robust, scalable systems while bridging the gap between front and backend development.
